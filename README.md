# VTT Observe
[![Push check](https://github.com/Ghifari160/vtt-observe/actions/workflows/push.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Ghifari160/vtt-observe/actions/workflows/push.yaml)

[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) extension to remove Roll20 UIs for observer account.

## Using the extension

Currently, there is no prebuilt version of this extension available.
This may change in the future, though I wouldn't hold your breath.

For now, you can [build](#building) the extension and load it to your Chrome profile as an unpacked
extension.
To do so, navigate to `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode, and add the `out` directory as
an unpacked extension.

## Building

VTT Observer requires [Node v19](https://nodejs.org/) and any version of
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

First, install dependencies.

``` shell
npm i
```

Then, build the _unpacked_ extension.

``` shell
npm run build
```

## Cleaning up

Simply run the cleanup script,

``` shell
npm run clean
```

or, the full cleanup script to additionally remove all generated scripts.

``` shell
npm run fullclean
```
